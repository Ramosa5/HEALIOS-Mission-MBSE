// DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - IT WILL BE REPLACING THE ORIGINAL ONE

// TO DO:
    // Check Space Segment and Ground Segment requirements for compliance.
    // Check that all Space Segment and Ground Segment requirements are correctly linked to the higher-level.
    // Check that all requirements are correctly linked to the relevant stakeholders and concerns.
// At the end:
    // Do satifaction and verification implementation.
    // Add additional tracability between requirements... Look for keywords like dependency or trace.
